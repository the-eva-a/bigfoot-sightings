I was standing beside my truck putting away some tools as we were talking.  I don\\'t know what made me turn and look up the driveway, as I did I saw a tall (large) hairy figure walking behind a duplex behind the garage.  This space between the building is approximately 20-25 feet.  I only saw this figure for a few seconds.  I turned to my ex-wife and said, \"Did I just see what I thought I saw?\" She asked \"What did you see?\" I said I believe I saw a Bigfoot.  Her response was, \"You finally saw it!\" She meant that she has had several encounters with this thing over the years. I walked across the street to where it was headed [into Lauritzen Gardens] in hopes to see it walking in the woods. I stood in an area where I could see where it might have went. I listened and looked for several minutes but I didn\\'t hear or see anything else. I left knowing that I saw something and just left it at that. About 4 hours later my ex-wife called and said there are two roofers working behind her house. My daughter\\'s boyfriend who is hispanic heard them talking in Spanish. They were saying that they just saw a monster. This confirmed to me that I really did see one.This area has had many sighting throughout the years.

My mom had a dumpster at the bottom of her driveway. As I pulled into the driveway around 3 a.m. I saw this large hairy figure standing right on the corner of the dumpster kind of behind it but not all the way.  As my headlights shined on it, it looked at me but did not move.  I was stiff as well. I tried to call my mom continuously but she did not answer the phone because I was going to run in the house through the front door. She never answered so I drove back to my cousins but they were already asleep. I ended up parking my car up the street and sleeping in it until my mom finally called me at 6 a.m. I told her what had happened and it did not surprise her a bit because she has been seeing the same thing for years.Summer 2006 I was sitting on the front of my moms steps and I seen a mom and baby across the street in the dead end.  I thought I was seeing things at first but I wasn\\'t.  It started to move out of the brush and into the street towards me. Then a car came down the street and turned into the dead end. They hurried back into the wooded area and waited there for a while watching the driver of the car turn around, park, get out and go into the house behind the duplexes.  Those people didn\\'t have a clue that these two things were watching them.  They stayed there for about five minutes and then they walked back into the woods and out of sight.Fall 2006, Once again I was sitting on my friends front steps and seen a large something what I believe to be a bigfoot, walk from Terry and Kathy\\'s yard towards the other dead end on the opposite side of the street.  It disappeared into the night.Summer of 2011, I had cooked out that evening and I had moved my baby grill over by the basement door so the smell of food was still present.  That night I was upstairs with my other two kids as my 14 yr. old son Brendan was downstairs watching T.V.  Everything was quiet until my son Brendan came running up the stairs crying hysterically and shaking. I had to slap him so he would come to and tell me what the heck was wrong. This is what he said....\"I was laying down on the couch in my nana\\'s basement just watching t.v. when he looked up at the door where there are three little windows present at the top of the door, as to what he describes as looking like a big hairy man with a scrunched in face and red eyes and it just stood there and looked at me. The shoulders took up the two squares of the outer windows and his head was in the middle. Summer 2011, My son Brendan went from my house which was 3 houses from my moms to go get something, He walked down the driveway about halfway and he was on the far left of the driveway and he witnessed a baby bigfoot by the stairs to my moms deck. He said he turned around and ran back to my house at that point. My sister sent in a report to you back in 2005 and I wrote this up because there have been sightings since then and I wanted you guys to know about them.  One of your BFRO researchers called my mom about a month or so ago and told us to write this up. I am submitting this to you in hopes that you guys will come and do some research down here in Omaha.

I am speaking on behalf of my mother. My mother first saw this \"thing \" when she was 10 years old. You have to understand the way the neighborhood we live in is set up. The house my mother lived in when she was 10 is less than a quarter mile away from the house that she lives in today. All of the yards in that neighborhood sort of connect with somewhat of a gully in the middle. The first time my mother had any knowledge of the thing, her sister and her were swinging on a double tire swing in her backyard. The next thing my mother knew, her sister had jumped off the swing and was running and screaming. My mom didn\\'t know what to do, so she ran after her sister into the house. Her sister was hysterical saying she saw something in the back wooded area of their yard. I guess my grandpa did find some sort of large footprints. This was the first incident.The next incident was when my mom was outside her house when she was young. She saw a large thing covered in hair walking across her driveway. My mom told me that the \"thing\" walked almost as if it was bo-legged. She also said it\\'s shoulders moved from side to side as it walked.Now my mother lives in the house I grew up in. As recently as two weeks ago, something has been seen in my mother\\'s back yard. It hasn\\'t only been seen by my mother, but also by my sister who frequently stays at my mom\\'s house.About three years ago (April of 2002) is when my mom had her most vivid and frightening encounter with the \"thing\". She was letting our dogs out in the backyard and they both went barreling towards the fence surrounding our yard barking. My mom walked out in the yard, thinking nothing other than the dogs were just being dogs, and was standing waiting for them to use the bathroom. It was then when she noticed something moving in the next yard. She said it was about seven feet tall and standing behind a tree. She said as fast as the dogs had ran up to the fence to bark, they were running back to the house yelping. My mom said she froze. She always tells me the fear that she feels when she sees this \"thing\" is overwhelming. She said it then \"leaped\" from behind one tree to another. That\\'s when she started running. She said she looked behind her and it was now coming forward towards her. She ran in the house and locked the doors.My mom lives in a brick house and she has also told me that on occasion she will hear something that sounds like something beating or throwing itself up against the side of her house.My mom is completely afraid of this \"thing\".', 'other witnesses': 'Two witnesses. Working just before or just being at home.', 'other stories': \"My father also grew up about a block away from my mom. Their family has their own stories from the same area. Other than that, we've never asked. We've come to figure that anyone else in the neighborhood who've maybe seen something, probably thinks everyone will think they're crazy. We've never asked anyone around there.\", 'time and conditions': 'Just before sunrise, clear and nice weather.', 'environment': 'Wooded area connected to backyards.'}\n"
