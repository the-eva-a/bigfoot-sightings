# AirBnB Where the B stands for Bigfoot

## Part I: Data Collection
We are collecting Bigfoot sighting data from [The Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization](www.bfro.net). 
This group has been collecting information and reports since 1995, giving it a large number of entries. 
The entries also have many of the qualities we are looking for. As the BFRO considers itself the only *scientific*
Bigfoot research group they seem to have dedicated themselves to a high quality of report
structure and organization. 

## Part II: Data Cleaning
This is what is currently haunting me thre is much to sort through to see what is useful. 
Thakfully we have `data\bare_bones_bigfoot` to play around with for now.
